        <h1 id="Blue-Jays-Prepare-for-Another-Flop"><a href="#Blue-Jays-Prepare-for-Another-Flop" class="headerlink" title="Blue Jays Prepare for Another Flop"></a>Blue Jays Prepare for Another Flop</h1><p>The Blue Jays 2017 season was a disappointment to say the least. Making only one appearance in the playoffs, they were eliminated by the Cleveland Indians in five games. The offseason brought little relief as they lost their star shortstop, José Reyes, to free agency. Fans are wondering if the team can make a comeback this year.</p>
<p> Management is hoping that the addition of some new players will help them secure a spot in the playoffs once again. Yangervis Solarte, Aledmys Diaz, and Randal Grichuk join the team this year and are expected to bring some much-needed power to the lineup. At the same time, Josh Donaldson, Justin Smoak, and Kevin Pillar will need to continue performing well if Toronto wants to have any chance of winning.</p>
<p>The pitching staff is also looking strong this year. In fact, many experts are predicting that this could be their best season yet. This is largely due to the performance of Aaron Sanchez and Marcus Stroman who both had impressive outings last year. If they can continue to deliver excellent performances on the mound, it will give the rest of the team a lot of leverage when it comes to winning games.</p>
<p>Despite these promising signs, there are still some concerns about how well the Blue Jays will fare this season. The division they play in is becoming increasingly competitive and it won’t be easy for them to surpass teams like Boston and New York. Additionally, their starting rotation isn’t as strong as some of the other teams in their division.</p>
<p>Ultimately, whether or not Toronto succeeds this year will depend on how well they play as a team. If everyone can put their personal goals aside and focus on helping each other win games, then they have a good chance of making it far into the playoffs. However, if egos get in the way or players start feuding with one another, then it could be another disappointing year for Blue Jays fans.</p>
<h1 id="Toronto-Blue-Jays-Continue-to-Fail-at-Poker"><a href="#Toronto-Blue-Jays-Continue-to-Fail-at-Poker" class="headerlink" title="Toronto Blue Jays Continue to Fail at Poker"></a>Toronto Blue Jays Continue to Fail at Poker</h1><p>The Toronto Blue Jays are continuing their downward slide in the poker world, as they have now failed to qualify for the World Series of Poker (WSOP) for the fourth consecutive year.</p>
<p>While the team has boasted some strong players in the past - including Daniel Negreanu and Jonathan Duhamel - they have been unable to put together a consistent run of good results in recent years.</p>
<p>In fact, their last appearance at the WSOP final table was all the way back in 2014, when Duhamel finished in 8th place.</p>
<p>This year’s tournament saw over 7,000 players competing for a piece of the $270 million prize pool, with only the top 9 places finishers taking home a payday.</p>
<p>The Blue Jays will now be looking to turn things around next year, but it won’t be easy given the increased competition at the top of the field.</p>
<h1 id="Blue-Jays-Fall-Short-Once-Again"><a href="#Blue-Jays-Fall-Short-Once-Again" class="headerlink" title="Blue Jays Fall Short Once Again"></a>Blue Jays Fall Short Once Again</h1><p>The Toronto Blue Jays entered the 2017 season with high expectations. Many pundits picked them to win the American League East, but they once again fell short.</p>
<p>Toronto finished the season with a record of 76-86, good for third place in the division. They were eliminated from playoff contention in late September.</p>
<p>The Blue Jays had some bright spots this season. Jose Bautista had a resurgent year, hitting 22 home runs and driving in 69 runs. Justin Smoak also had a strong season, hitting 38 home runs and driving in 90 runs.</p>
<p>However, the team’s pitching staff was largely a disappointment. The team’s two most reliable starters, Aaron Sanchez and Marco Estrada, both had disappointing seasons. The bullpen was also a mess, with Tyler Clippard and Roberto Osuna both struggling at times.</p>
<p>The Blue Jays are likely to make some changes this offseason. Bautista and Smoak are both free agents and it’s unclear if either will be back next year. The team is also likely to pursue some new starting pitchers in free agency or via trade.</p>
<p>If the Blue Jays can address their pitching woes, they could be contenders again in 2018. However, there are no guarantees and it remains to be seen if they can finally break through and reach the playoffs.</p>
<h1 id="Is-the-Poker-Toronto-Blue-Jays-Curse-Finally-Over"><a href="#Is-the-Poker-Toronto-Blue-Jays-Curse-Finally-Over" class="headerlink" title="Is the Poker Toronto Blue Jays Curse Finally Over?"></a>Is the Poker Toronto Blue Jays Curse Finally Over?</h1><p>The Toronto Blue Jays have not been to the playoffs since 1993. That’s a long time. In that year, they made it all the way to the World Series but lost to the Philadelphia Phillies. Some say that this was the beginning of the “Poker Toronto Blue Jays Curse”.</p>
<p>Many people have high hopes for the Blue Jays this year. They are currently in first place in their division and many experts believe that they have a good chance of making it to the playoffs. If they do manage to make it all the way to the World Series, will they finally be able to break the curse?</p>
<p>There are some pretty good players on this team, including José Bautista and Edwin Encarnacion. Both of these players are known for their home runs. The Blue Jays also have a strong pitching lineup, led by R.A. Dickey and Josh Johnson.</p>
<p>It is definitely going to be an exciting season!</p>
<h1 id="Blue-Jays-Falter-on-the-Road-to-Las-Vegas"><a href="#Blue-Jays-Falter-on-the-Road-to-Las-Vegas" class="headerlink" title="Blue Jays Falter on the Road to Las Vegas"></a>Blue Jays Falter on the Road to Las Vegas</h1><p>The Toronto Blue Jays had a tough time on the road in their series against the Las Vegas 51s. The Blue Jays lost all three games, with scores of 1-7, 2-5, and 4-7.</p>
<p>In the first game, starting pitcher Sean Reid-Foley allowed seven runs over five innings. Meanwhile, the Blue Jays’ only run came from a solo home run by outfielder Randal Grichuk in the fourth inning.</p>
<p>The second game was closer, with the Blue Jays losing 5-2. starter Trent Thornton gave up five runs over six innings, and reliever Tim Mayza gave up an additional run. Outfielder Dwight Smith Jr. hit his sixth home run of the season in the game.</p>
<p>The final game was another blowout, with the 51s winning 7-4. Starter Marcus Stroman allowed four runs over three innings, and reliever Ryan Tepera gave up an additional three runs. Designated hitter Justin Smoak hit his 21st home run of the season in the game.</p>
<p>Despite their losses on the road, the Blue Jays are still in first place in their division with a record of 73-57. They will return to Toronto to face off against the Baltimore Orioles for a four-game series starting on August 27th.</p>
