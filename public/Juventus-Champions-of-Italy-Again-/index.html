        <h1 id="Juventus-Champions-of-Italy-Again"><a href="#Juventus-Champions-of-Italy-Again" class="headerlink" title="Juventus Champions of Italy Again"></a>Juventus Champions of Italy Again</h1><p>For the 34th time in their history, Juventus are crowned champions of Italy. The Turin outfit had to work for it on the final day of the season, but thanks to a 1-0 win away at relegated Crotone and Napoli’s 2-1 defeat away at Roma, they are champions of Serie A once again.</p>
<p>It was a tale of two strikers throughout the season for Juventus. Gonzalo Higuaín led the charge with 24 goals in all competitions before being controversially sold to Chelsea in January, while Paulo Dybala stepped up in his absence with 14 goals in his last 16 appearances.</p>
<p>In goal, Gianluigi Buffon enjoyed yet another successful season at the club, making crucial saves when needed and breaking numerous records along the way. In defence, Leonardo Bonucci’s departure to AC Milan was more than adequately filled by the arrival of Mattia De Sciglio from AC Milan and Mehdi Benatia from Bayern Munich.</p>
<p>The midfield remains unchanged with Miralem Pjanic pulling the strings and Claudio Marchisio and Sami Khedira providing cover, while Alex Sandro has been one of Juventus’ most consistent performers down the left wing this season.</p>
<p>Juventus will now look ahead to their Champions League semi-final against Monaco as they bid for an eighth European Cup&#x2F;Champions League title.</p>
<h1 id="Milan-and-Roma-Battle-it-Out-for-Second-Place"><a href="#Milan-and-Roma-Battle-it-Out-for-Second-Place" class="headerlink" title="Milan and Roma Battle it Out for Second Place"></a>Milan and Roma Battle it Out for Second Place</h1><p>As the season comes to a close, the battle for second place is heating up. Milan and Roma are both in contention, and they will clash this weekend in what is sure to be an exciting match.</p>
<p>Milan has had a good season overall, but they have been inconsistent lately. They come into this match in third place, and they will be looking to secure second place with a win.</p>
<p>Roma has had a solid season as well, and they currently sit in second place. They will be looking to hold on to that spot with a win over Milan.</p>
<p>These two teams have met twice already this season, with each team winning once. This weekend’s match should be just as exciting as those previous meetings.</p>
<p>Both Milan and Roma are loaded with talent, and it should be a hard-fought battle between these two clubs. Whoever comes out on top will take a big step towards securing second place in the table.</p>
<h1 id="Atalanta-in-the-Hunt-for-European-Football"><a href="#Atalanta-in-the-Hunt-for-European-Football" class="headerlink" title="Atalanta in the Hunt for European Football"></a>Atalanta in the Hunt for European Football</h1><p>For any football fan, the chance to see your team play in one of European football’s premier tournaments is a dream come true. This season, Italian side Atalanta are on the hunt for a place in the Europa League, and they are doing everything they can to make it to the big stage.</p>
<p>Atalanta began their campaign with a hard-fought victory over Cyprus’s Apollon Limassol. The win was not without controversy, however, as Atalanta were down to 10 men for most of the game after defender José Luis Palomino was sent off. Despite being a man down, Atalanta were able to score two goals in the second half courtesy of Bryan Cristante and Andreas Gomez to seal the win.</p>
<p> Their next match was a much easier affair, as they cruised to a 3-0 win over Israel’s Bnei Yehuda Tel Aviv. Gomez once again found the back of the net, scoring twice, with captain Alejandro Gomez also getting on the scoresheet.</p>
<p>Next up was a trip to Rome to take on Lazio in what was always going to be a difficult match. Lazio are one of Italy’s top sides and are always looking to add silverware to their trophy cabinet. However, Atalanta did not show any signs of intimidation and took the lead early on through Bryan Cristante. The home side eventually pegged them back late on through Sergej Milinkovic-Savic but Atalanta held on for an important away point.</p>
<p>Their final group match saw them take on FC Copenhagen at home. With qualification already all but assured, Atalanta took their foot off the gas somewhat and played out a 0-0 draw.</p>
<p>Now into the knockout stages, Atalanta face Dutch side AZ Alkmaar in what looks like being one of the toughest ties of the round of 32. AZ have plenty of experience in European competition and will be looking to knock out an up-and-coming Italian side such as Atalanta.</p>
<p>  So far this season, La Dea (The Goddess), as Atalanta are nicknamed, have been impressive both in Serie A and in Europe. Led by captain Alejandro Gomez and midfield schemer Bryan Cristante – on loan from Serie A rivals Inter Milan – they have shown that they can compete with some of Europe’s biggest clubs.</p>
<h1 id="Napoli-Struggle-Without-Costa"><a href="#Napoli-Struggle-Without-Costa" class="headerlink" title="Napoli Struggle Without Costa"></a>Napoli Struggle Without Costa</h1><p>After Gonzalo Higuain’s record-breaking move to Juventus last summer, Napoli have been struggling to find a goalscoring partner for midfielder Marek Hamsik. Their search has taken them far and wide, with bids being made for the likes of Javier Hernandez, Arkadiusz Milik and Leonardo Pavoletti.</p>
<p>However, their quest has been in vain, as Manager Maurizio Sarri has yet to find a player who can replace the Argentinean hitman. This was painfully evident in their recent 3-1 defeat away to Atalanta, where Dries Mertens was the only player to score for the Partenopei.</p>
<p>This lack of a goalscorer is severely hampering Napoli’s chances of success this season, as they currently sit in 5th place in Serie A, 9 points behind leaders Juventus. Sarri will need to find an answer soon if he wants his side to be competitive in both the league and Champions League.</p>
<p>One possible solution could be to recall former striker Edinson Cavani from Paris Saint-Germain. The Uruguayan international has been struggling for game time at PSG this season, and may be willing to return to Naples in order to recapture his best form.</p>
<p>Cavani would certainly be a valuable addition to Sarri’s squad, as he has proven himself as one of the most lethal strikers in world football. He would also provide some much needed experience in Europe’s top competition, as Napoli continue their quest for Champions League glory.</p>
<h1 id="Inter-Milan-Among-the-Relegation-Battles"><a href="#Inter-Milan-Among-the-Relegation-Battles" class="headerlink" title="Inter Milan Among the Relegation Battles"></a>Inter Milan Among the Relegation Battles</h1><p>Just a few months ago, Inter Milan was one of the title challengers in the Serie A. However, their form has taken a nosedive in recent weeks, with manager Luciano Spalletti coming under pressure as a result. With just two wins in their last 10 league games, Inter are now embroiled in a relegation battle.</p>
<p>One of the main reasons for their struggles has been the poor performances of Mauro Icardi. The Argentine striker has been out of form all season, and he has failed to score in his last six league games. In addition, the team’s defence has been very leaky, conceding 24 goals in their last 10 league games.</p>
<p>With matches against top-six sides Juventus, Napoli and Roma still to come, Inter could find themselves relegated if they continue to play this way. It will be interesting to see how Spalletti handles the pressure over the coming weeks.</p>
