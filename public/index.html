While card counting is not illegal, it is heavily frowned upon by casinos and can result in being banned from playing. That being said, here are some tips on when to bet while counting cards in blackjack.</p>
<h2 id="The-Basics-of-Counting-Cards"><a href="#The-Basics-of-Counting-Cards" class="headerlink" title="The Basics of Counting Cards"></a>The Basics of Counting Cards</h2><p>Before getting into when to bet, it’s important to understand the basics of counting cards. Essentially, card counting involves keeping track of the ratio of high cards (10s and aces) to low cards (2s, 3s, 4s, 5s, and 6s) that have been dealt. When there are more high cards left in the deck, the odds are in the player’s favor, and when there are more low cards left, the odds are in the dealer’s favor. </p>
<p>There are several card counting systems, but the most commonly used is the Hi-Lo system. In this system, low cards (2s, 3s, 4s, 5s, and 6s) are assigned a value of +1, and high cards (10s and aces) are assigned a value of -1. 7s, 8s, and 9s are considered neutral and do not affect the count. As the cards are dealt, the player keeps a running count in their head. </p>
<h2 id="When-to-Bet"><a href="#When-to-Bet" class="headerlink" title="When to Bet"></a>When to Bet</h2><p>Once you have a running count, you need to determine the true count. To do this, divide the running count by the number of decks left in the shoe. For example, if the running count is +6 and there are two decks left in the shoe, the true count is +3. </p>
<p>Now, you need to adjust your bet based on the true count. When the true count is +1 or less, it’s best to bet the minimum. When the true count is +2 or +3, you can start increasing your bet. When the true count is +4 or higher, you should be betting your maximum bet. </p>
<p>It’s important to note that you should never bet more than you can afford to lose. Additionally, it’s important to keep your bet sizes consistent. This helps prevent drawing attention to yourself and can help you avoid being kicked out of the casino. </p>
<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Counting cards in blackjack can be a lucrative strategy, but it requires practice and discipline. Knowing when to bet based on the count is crucial for maximizing your winnings, but it’s important to bet responsibly and consistently. Remember, card counting is not illegal, but it’s highly frowned upon by casinos and can result in being banned from playing. Use this strategy at your own risk.</p>

<li>Learn about the different types of bets available</li>
<li>Understand the factors that affect the outcome of games</li>
<li>Develop a system for choosing specific games to bet on</li>
<li>Manage your bankroll responsibly</li>
<li>Stay disciplined and stick to your system</li>
<li>Be prepared to lose some bets along the way</li>
<li>Enjoy the journey!</li>
</ol>
<p>Let’s take a closer look at each of these points:</p>
<ol>
<li>Learn about the different types of bets available - There are many different types of bets you can place when betting on sports, and each type has its own advantages and disadvantages. The most basic type of bet is the straight bet, which is simply choosing one team or player to win against another team or player. Another common type of bet is the parlay, where multiple bets are placed together and all must win for the bettor to collect payout. There are also prop bets (which are bets made on specific events occurring during a game), teasers (a type of parlay where point spreads are adjusted in favour of the gambler) and much more. It’s important to understand all these different types of bets so that you can make informed decisions when placing your wagers. </li>
<li>Understand the factors that affect the outcome of games - There are many factors that can affect the outcome of sporting events, including injuries, weather conditions, home field advantage and more. It’s important to have a good understanding of these factors so that you can make smarter bets and increase your chances of winning.   3) Develop a system for choosing specific games to bet on - This is probably one of the most important things you can do if you want to be successful at sports betting. Developing a system for choosing specific games will help remove some of the guesswork from your decision-making process and increase your chances or winning overall. Some things you may want to consider include recent form, head-to-head results, team news and other factors that may be relevant to that particular sport or game.   4) Manage your bankroll responsibly - One of the biggest mistakes new gamblers make is not managing their bankroll properly . This means not only ensuring that you have enough money set aside for gambling purposes , but also ensuring that you don’t gamble with more money than you can afford to lose . It’s important to remember that even if you have a winning streak , there will inevitably be downswings too , so don’t risk more than you’re comfortable losing .  5) Stay disciplined and stick to your system - Gambling is all about discipline . If you’re not able to stay disciplined and stick with your system , then you’re going nowhere fast . A successful gambler knows when to hold ‘em and when to fold ‘em , knows when it’s time ot walk away from th table an knows when t o putt extra effort in an seek ou expert advice . 6) Be preparedto lose some bets alongthe way - One thingyouneedtorememberisthattheoddsarealwaysagainstyouwhengambling .Evenifyouhaveacertaintyofwinningaynumbersbat ,theriskinvolvedmeansthatthereisstillaclauseinthelawofthespecialisedindustrythatthemajorityofbetsplacedwilllose .Thisdoesn’tmeanyoushouldgiveupjustbecausethereishighprobabilityoflosing ;rather,itisanadmissionthateverygamblersufferslossesalongtheway .Thekeyistostickwithyoursystemandconsistentlybetonthemthingsyoubelieveinyouselves . 7) Enjoythejourney!- lastly ,rememberthatgamblingisfun !Beopenmindedaboutyourwinningsandlosingsandenjoytheexperienceofplacingbetsandfollowingyourteamsthroughouttheirgames !Gamblingisadaysubjecttosuchadiversityandafterallenjoymentisthemostimportantpartofthewholepackage !</li>

Below, we will take a look at some of the best tips that you can use, so that you can start winning more bets and making more money.</p>
<p>First and foremost, it is important to do your research. This means looking into the teams and players involved in each match-up, as well as studying past results. By doing this, you will be able to get a good idea of what is likely to happen, and make more informed bets.</p>
<p>Another thing that you can do is to keep track of current form. This means keeping tabs on how both teams and individual players are performing recently. If a team or player is on a losing streak, then it might be wise to avoid betting on them until they start winning again.</p>
<p>In addition to this, be sure to bet on games that you know something about. This will help you make better decisions, as you will have a better understanding of how each team plays and which strategies are likely to work best.</p>
<p>You should also try not to bet too much money at once. This way, if you lose some bets, it won’t hurt as much financially. And finally, always make sure that you are betting with reputable bookmakers, so that you don’t run the risk of being scammed.</p>

In this article, we’ll show you how to do it.</p>
<p>We’ll start with the basics: what you need to create a Blackjack game. Here’s a list of the basic requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>An HTML editor (or text editor)</li>
<li>A web browser</li>
<li>Basic coding knowledge (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you have those things, you’re ready to get started! Let’s begin by creating the structure of our game. We’ll need two pages: one for the game itself, and one for the instructions. We’ll start with the game page.</p>
<p>The game page will have three sections: the header, the gameplay area, and the footer. The header will contain information about the game, such as the name and version number. The gameplay area will include the cards and table, while the footer will have buttons for players to click on in order to make their moves. Here’s an example of what it will look like:</p>
<!DOCTYPE html> <html lang="en"> <head> <title>Blackjack</title> </head> <body> <header>Blackjack</header> <section id="gameplay"> <!-- The table and cards go here --> </section> <footer> <button id="hit">Hit</button> <button id="stand">Stand</button> <button id="double">Double</button> <button id="split">Split</button> </footer> </body> </html>

<p>Now that we have the structure of our page set up, let’s add some code to make it actually work! We’ll start with the header section. For this part, we’ll just need to add some text stating when and where the game was created. Here’s an example:</p>
<header><h1><span class="game-name">Blackjack</span></h1></header> <p class="created-at">Created by John Doe on Jul 21, 2019</p>

<p>Next, we’ll work on the gameplay area. This is where all of the action will take place! We’ll first create a function that checks whether or not a player has won. This function will take two parameters: player1 and dealer . It will return a value of either true or false depending on whether or not player1 has beaten dealer . Here’s how it looks:</p>
<p>function win(player1, dealer){ 	var total &#x3D; player1 + dealer; 	if(total &gt; 21){ 		return false; 	}else{ 		return true; 	} }</p>
<p>Next, we’ll add code to deal out cards to both player1 and dealer . We’ll also use jQuery to dynamically generate table rows and cells as needed. Here’s all of the code together:</p>
<p>function init(){ 	var elem &#x3D; document.getElementById(‘gameplay’); 	var numRows &#x3D; 5; &#x2F;&#x2F; Number of rows in table 	var numColumns &#x3D; 3; &#x2F;&#x2F; Number of columns in table 	var player1 &#x3D; { “card”: [], “total”: 0 }; &#x2F;&#x2F; Initialize player 1 data 	var dealer &#x3D; { “card”: [], “total”: 0 }; &#x2F;&#x2F; Initialize dealer data 	elem.innerHTML &#x3D; ‘<table border="1"><tbody><tr><th scope="row" class="player-name colHeading">Player 1</th><th scope="col" class="card suit colHeading">Suit</th><th scope="col" class="card rank colHeading">Rank</th></tr><tr><td class="player-name colActive"></td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>‘; &#x2F;&#x2F; Add basic table formatting elem.insertBefore(elem.children[0], document.getElementById(‘header’)); &#x2F;&#x2F; Insert header row }</p>
<p>First we create two arrays called player1 and dealer which will store each player’s card data respectively. Next we use jQuery to insert an empty table into our HTML document and add basic formatting using th elements (for table headers). Then we use jQuery again to dynamically generate as many rows and cells as needed based on our numRows and numColumns variables . Finally we populate each cell with corresponding data from our arrays using innerHTML .</p>

<h1 id="How-To-Create-A-Blackjack-Game-In-Less-Than-An-Hour"><a href="#How-To-Create-A-Blackjack-Game-In-Less-Than-An-Hour" class="headerlink" title="How To Create A Blackjack Game In Less Than An Hour"></a>How To Create A Blackjack Game In Less Than An Hour</h1><p>In this article, we are going to create a blackjack game from scratch in less than an hour. We will use the HTML5 and JavaScript frameworks to create the user interface and the game logic.</p>
<p>First, we need to create the HTML document. We will declare a main <div> element to hold the game’s user interface:</p>
<p>&lt;! DOCTYPE html &gt; &lt; html lang &#x3D; “ en “ &gt; &lt; head &gt; &lt; meta charset &#x3D; “ UTF-8 “ &gt; &lt; title &gt; Blackjack Game &lt;&#x2F; title &gt; &lt;&#x2F; head &gt; &lt; body &gt; &lt; div id &#x3D; “ main-container “ class &#x3D; “ container “ &gt; &lt;&#x2F; div &gt; &lt;&#x2F; body &gt; &lt;&#x2F; html &gt;</p>
<p>Next, we need to add some basic styles to our document. We will use the Bootstrap CSS framework to style our user interface:</p>
<ul>
<li>{ margin : 0 ; padding : 0 ; } body { font-family : ‘Helvetica Neue’ , Arial, sans-serif ; } .container { max-width : 1200px ; margin : 0 auto ; } .header { background-color : #fff ; padding : 15px 20px ; margin-bottom : 20px ; } .main-content { background-color : #fff ; padding : 15px 20px ; } .footer { background-color : #fff ; padding : 15px 20px ; margin-bottom : 20px ; }</li>
</ul>
<p>Now let’s add the code for the game’s user interface. We will use an HTML5 <canvas> element to render the game graphics:</p>
<!-- The canvas element --> < canvas id = " blackjack-canvas " width = " 600 " height = " 400 " class = " hidden-printable canvasjs__canvas glyphicon glyphicon--cash js__canvas__hidden printable js__"></ canvas > <!-- The dock --> < div class = " dock hidden-printable js__dock glyphicon glyphicon--trash js__dock__hidden printable js__"></ div > <!-- The table --> < table class = " table table--striped js__table tablejs__table" cellspacing = " 0 " cellpadding = " 0 " border = " 0 " rules = " colsfirst"> <!-- The cards --> < tbody data - rowsource - templateref = ' cards '> <!-- The top row of cards --> < tr data - rowsource - templateref = ' first '> <!-- The left column of cards --> < td >< img src = ' https://blackjackinfo.com/images/cards/Ace.png ' alt = ' Ace of Spades '></ td >< td >< img src = ' https://blackjackinfo.com/images/cards/Two.png ' alt = ' Two of Spades '></ td >< td >< img src = ' https://blackjackinfo.com/images/cards/Three.png ' alt = ' Three of Spades '></ td >< td >< img src = ' https://blackjackinfo.com/images/cards/Four.png' alt=''>Four of Spades</td><td><img src="https://blackjackinfo.com/images/cards/Five.png" alt="">Five of Spades</td><td><img src="https://blackjackinfo.com/images/cards/Six.png" alt="">Six of Spades</td><td><img src="https://blackjackinfo.com/images /cards /Seven . png" alt="">>Seven of Spades</td></tr> <!-- The next row of cards --> < tr data - rowsource - templateref =='second'> <!-- The right column of cards --> < td >< img src='https://blackjackinfo . com / images / cards / Eight . png' alt=' Eight of Spades'></ td >< td >< img src='https:// black jackinfo . com / images / cards / Nine . png' alt='Nine of Spades'/></td><td><img src='https:// black jackinfo . com / images / cards / Ten . png' alt='TenofSpades'/></td><td >< img src='https:// black jackinfo . com / images / cards / Jack . png'alt='JackofSpades'/></td><td><imgsrc=" https: // black jack info . com / images /* card */ Queen . png"alt='QueenofSpades'/></tbdy> <!-- The bottom row of cads --> < tr data - ro w source - templateref ==' third'> <!--The left column ov cards--> < td >< img src='https:/ // black jack info com // images // car ds // King spa ded s'.png'alt=''>Kingof

This guide will walk you through the process of creating a basic blackjack game from scratch.</p>
<h2 id="Getting-Started"><a href="#Getting-Started" class="headerlink" title="Getting Started"></a>Getting Started</h2><p>First, you’ll need to create a new project in your favorite programming language. We’ll be using JavaScript for this tutorial, but you can use any language you like.</p>
<p>Next, we’ll create a basic HTML file to house our game. This file will contain all of the necessary markup to display our game on the page.</p>
<p>In the <head> of our HTML file, we’ll add some basic styling information to make our game look nicer:</p>
<style>

body { background-color: #E6E6E6; }

 h1 { font-size: 3em; margin: 0 0 2em 0; }

 .game-window { width: 900px; height: 600px; border: 1px solid black; margin: auto; }

 .card { font-size: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 10px; }

 .button { font-size: 1.2em; margin-bottom: 5px; }

</style>

<p>Now we can add the markup for our game window. This will consist of a <div> element with the class name “game-window”:</p>
<div class="game-window"> </div>

<p>We’ll also add a div element for each card in the deck. These cards will be displayed as images, and we’ll give each one a unique class name so that we can easily style them later:</p>
<div class="card"> </div>
<div class="card"> </div><div class="card"> </div><div class="card"> </div><div class="card"> </div><div class="card"> </div><div class="card"> </div><div class="card"> </div><div class="card"> </ div> <h1>Step-By-Step Guide To Making Your Own Blackjack Game</h1>  <p>Making your own blackjack game is a fun and challenging project.

<h1 id="Create-Your-Own-Blackjack-Game-In-Just-5-Simple-Steps"><a href="#Create-Your-Own-Blackjack-Game-In-Just-5-Simple-Steps" class="headerlink" title="Create Your Own Blackjack Game In Just 5 Simple Steps!"></a>Create Your Own Blackjack Game In Just 5 Simple Steps!</h1><p>It’s easy to create your own blackjack game. You just need to follow these five simple steps:</p>
<p>Step 1: Choose a Playing Deck</p>
<p>The first step is to choose a playing deck. You can use any type of deck you want, but a standard deck of 52 cards is most common.</p>
<p>Step 2: Create the Cards</p>
<p>Now you need to create the cards. Each card will have two sides, one with the rank and one with the suit. You can either create them yourself or find a free template online. Here are the ranks and suits for a standard deck of cards:</p>
<p>Rank Suit King Clubs Queen Spades Jack Hearts 10 Diamonds 9 Clubs 8 Spades 7 Hearts 6 Diamonds 5 Clubs 4 Spades 3 Hearts 2 Diamonds Ace Clubs King Hearts Queen Spades Jack Clubs 10 Diamonds 9 Hearts 8 Diamonds 7 Spades 6 Hearts 5 Hearts 4 Clubs 3 Hearts 2 Spades Ace hearts</p>
<p>Step 3: Set Up the Game Board</p>
<p>The next step is to set up the game board. This will include the playing area and all of the card slots. You can use any type of board you want, but a simple piece of paper works fine. Just draw a rectangular grid with 13 rows and 4 columns. The first column should be numbered 1-13 and the second row should be labelled A-L (for left). The third row should be labelled 1-4 and the fourth row should be labelled 1-4. Your game board should look something like this:</p>
<p>A 1 2 3 4 B 5 6 7 8 C 9 10 11 12 D 13 14 15 16 E 17 18 19 20 F 21 22 23 24 G 25 26 27 28 H 29 30 31 32 I 33 34 35 36 J 37 38 39 40 K 41 42 43 44 L 45 46 47 48</p>
<p>Step 4: Deal Out the Cards</p>
<p>The next step is to deal out the cards. This can be done randomly or by drawing cards from a shuffled deck. Make sure each player has two cards face down in front of them. The player with the highest rank card starts the game. Play then proceeds clockwise around the table. If both players have the same rank card, then play begins with the player on the left side of who originally started play (the dealer in this case). Here are some other rules that apply during play: 	If both players have an ace, then it becomes a “ standoff ” and both players keep their ace 	If one player has an ace and another player has a two , then the two becomes an eleven 	If one player has an ace and another player has a king , then it becomes an ace </p>
<p> Step 5: Winning &amp; Losing</p>
<h1 id="Learn-How-To-Make-A-Professional-Blackjack-Game-In-Minutes"><a href="#Learn-How-To-Make-A-Professional-Blackjack-Game-In-Minutes" class="headerlink" title="Learn How To Make A Professional Blackjack Game In Minutes!"></a>Learn How To Make A Professional Blackjack Game In Minutes!</h1><p>Making a blackjack game is a fun and easy project that can be completed in a few hours. In this article, we will walk you through the steps required to make your own blackjack game.</p>
<p>To start, we will create the basic structure of the game. This includes the deck of cards, the table, and the player interface. We will also add some basic logic to get things started.</p>
<p>Next, we will create the dealer interface. This includes the dealer’s hand, as well as the options available to the player.</p>
<p>Finally, we will add some finishing touches to our game, including animation and sound effects. Let’s get started!</p>
<h3 id="The-Deck-of-Cards"><a href="#The-Deck-of-Cards" class="headerlink" title="The Deck of Cards"></a>The Deck of Cards</h3><p>The first thing we need for our blackjack game is a deck of cards. We can create this using an array of objects. Here is an example:</p>
<p>var deck &#x3D; []; &#x2F;&#x2F; An array of objects representing a deck of cards for (var i &#x3D; 0; i &lt; 52; ++i) { deck[i] &#x3D; { suit: ‘clubs’, value: i }; }</p>
<p>We can then iterate over this array to generate a random deck of cards. Here is an example:</p>
<p>function shuffle(deck) { &#x2F;&#x2F; Shuffle the deck of cards var shuffled &#x3D; []; for (var i &#x3D; 0; i &lt; 52; ++i) { shuffled[i] &#x3D; deck[Math.floor(Math.random() * 52)] }; Array.prototype.splice.call(deck, 0, shuffled); } &#x2F;&#x2F; Use the shuffle function to randomly select cards from the deck shuffle(deck);</p>

At the time, Reverend Owen was working with the local tribespeople to teach them about Christianity. He created the game as a way to help teach the numbers and educate the people about Bingo’s origins.</p>
<p>Although it was created in Africa, Bingo quickly spread to other parts of the world. In fact, it became so popular that it was eventually declared a national game in several countries, including Italy and Germany. Today, Bingo is enjoyed by people of all ages and continues to be one of the most popular games around.</p>
<p>So how does Bingo work? The basic premise is that players mark off numbers on their cards as they are called out by the caller. The first player to achieve a predetermined pattern (usually five in a row) wins the game. There are many different variations of Bingo, so be sure to check out your favorite casino or gaming site for more details.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for a fun and exciting new game to try out, be sure to check out Bingo! It’s perfect for players of all levels and can be enjoyed by people of all ages.</p>
<h1 id="The-Fascinating-History-of-Bingo-From-Tanzania-to-the-Worldwide-Stage"><a href="#The-Fascinating-History-of-Bingo-From-Tanzania-to-the-Worldwide-Stage" class="headerlink" title="The Fascinating History of Bingo: From Tanzania to the Worldwide Stage"></a>The Fascinating History of Bingo: From Tanzania to the Worldwide Stage</h1><p>The game of bingo has a long and interesting history, dating back centuries to its origins in Africa. From there, it spread to Europe and then the rest of the world. Here’s a look at the fascinating history of this popular pastime.</p>
<p>The game of bingo is thought to have originated in Africa, where it was known as minkisi. This version of the game was played by tribesmen who would use animal bones or other objects to create a mat on which they would mark off numbers. The first winner would be determined by the person who matched all the numbers on their card.</p>
<p>It wasn’t long before bingo made its way to Europe, where it underwent several changes. For instance, in Italy it became known as biribi, while in France it was called loto. These versions of the game were typically played by wealthy people in private clubs. In Spain, meanwhile, bingo was used as a way to raise money for charity.</p>
<p>Bingo eventually made its way to North America in the 1920s, where it was initially marketed as a game for women. It soon became popular with men as well, and by the 1930s it had gained widespread popularity throughout North America. In 1934, the first commercial bingo hall opened in Atlanta, Georgia.</p>
<p>In the years that followed, bingo continued to grow in popularity worldwide. In 1992, for instance, more than 100 million people played bingo in some form or another. Today, bingo is enjoyed by people of all ages and nationalities around the globe. Whether you’re playing online or at your local hall, there’s nothing quite like that winning feeling!</p>
<h1 id="How-Bingo-Reached-Tanzania-and-What-Kept-it-There"><a href="#How-Bingo-Reached-Tanzania-and-What-Kept-it-There" class="headerlink" title="How Bingo Reached Tanzania and What Kept it There"></a>How Bingo Reached Tanzania and What Kept it There</h1><p>The Bingo craze that swept the world in the early 1990s reached Tanzania in 1995 and has not left since. What is it about this simple game of chance that has held such a grip on the Tanzanian people?</p>
<p>One theory is that bingo’s popularity in Tanzania is due to the fact that it is one of the few games that people can play without any equipment or special skills. All you need to play bingo is some paper and pencils to mark off numbers, and someone to call out the numbers. This means that bingo can be played anywhere, anytime, making it perfect for filling those idle moments.</p>
<p>Another likely factor in bingo’s enduring popularity in Tanzania is its social aspect. Bingo is a great way for people to get together and chat while playing a fun game. In a country where many people live far from their families, bingo provides a much-needed opportunity for socializing with friends and family members.</p>
<p>Whatever the reasons for its popularity, it seems clear that bingo will continue to be a popular pastime in Tanzania for years to come.</p>
<h1 id="Bingo-in-Tanzania-A-Traditional-Pastime"><a href="#Bingo-in-Tanzania-A-Traditional-Pastime" class="headerlink" title="Bingo in Tanzania: A Traditional Pastime"></a>Bingo in Tanzania: A Traditional Pastime</h1><p>Namesake of the game, bingo has its origins in Italy. But it was in Britain that this simple pastime became a sensation, with bingo halls mushrooming all over the country in the 1930s. So popular did bingo become that even the government got involved, instituting a national lottery in 1957 in order to garner much needed revenue for social welfare programs.</p>
<p>But where did bingo come from in the first place? The answer lies with the Italian game of Loteria, which is thought to have originated in the 1500s. Loteria is a game of chance that uses cards with pictures of animals, fruits, or numbers instead of numbers like in bingo. It was brought to Spain by the Moors and then to Mexico by Spanish settlers.</p>
<p>Fast-forwarding a few centuries, we find ourselves in early 20th century America where lotteries were all the rage. In fact, it was an American immigrant named Edwin S. Lowe who is credited with actually inventing modern day bingo. Lowe was playing a game of lotteries with his friends one night when someone had to leave early. To keep things interesting for those who remained, Lowe came up with a new game using ping-pong balls and numbered cards. He called it Beano (a wordplay on “bean” since players would place beans on their cards to mark off numbers as they were called). When Lowe tried to market his game, though, he found that no one wanted to play something called Beano. It was only when he changed the name to bingo that sales took off.</p>
<p>Bingo enjoyed immense popularity in Britain throughout the 1930s and 40s before crossing over to America in the 1950s. Today it is played all around the world, with variations depending on the country or region. In some places (like Italy), players use tarot cards instead of numbered cards. And while most versions of bingo are played using 75 balls, some countries (like China) play with 90 or even 100 balls!</p>
<p>Though its exact origins are unknown, what we do know is that bingo is a simple yet hugely entertaining game that has been enjoyed by people for centuries. So next time you’re feeling lucky, why not give bingo a try? You might just end up winning big!</p>
<h1 id="A-Look-at-the-Evolution-of-Bingo-and-its-Tanzanian-Origins"><a href="#A-Look-at-the-Evolution-of-Bingo-and-its-Tanzanian-Origins" class="headerlink" title="A Look at the Evolution of Bingo and its Tanzanian Origins"></a>A Look at the Evolution of Bingo and its Tanzanian Origins</h1><p>Bingo is a classic game that has been around for centuries, originating in Italy in the 1500s. It was often played by aristocrats in Italy and France, and eventually made its way to the United States. Bingo is now enjoyed by people of all ages all over the world, and has even been adapted for online play.</p>
<p>While there are many variations of bingo, the basic premise is always the same: players try to match numbers called out by the announcer to those on their cards. The first player to cover all of their numbers wins the game.</p>
<p>Interestingly, bingo has a long history in Africa as well. Tanzanian tribes have been playing a game called mbirango for centuries, which is thought to be the precursor to modern-day bingo. Mbirango is a game where players use sticks or seeds to mark off numbers as they are called. The first player to mark off all of their numbers wins the game.</p>
<p>There are many similarities between mbirango and modern-day bingo, including the use of cards and numbered balls. It’s fascinating to think that this classic game originated in Africa centuries ago – and that it’s still enjoyed today by people all over the world!</p>

It was founded on November 26, 1917, 24 years after the first indoor ice hockey game was played. The NHL is made up of 31 teams: 23 in the United States and 8 in Canada.</p>
<p>The Stanley Cup is the most prestigious trophy awarded to the best team in the NHL playoffs. The Cup is named after Lord Stanley of Preston, who was the Governor General of Canada at the time it was donated in 1893. The first team to win the Stanley Cup were the Montreal Amateur Athletic Association (now known as Les Canadiens).</p>
<p>Ice hockey is a popular sport enjoyed by people all over the world. In this article, we will show you how to hack your way to victory in the NHL!</p>
<p>First, you need to understand the basic rules of ice hockey. Ice hockey is a fast-paced sport that requires speed, agility and stamina. There are six players on each team: one goaltender and five skaters. The aim of the game is to score more goals than your opponent.</p>
<p>To score a goal, you need to shoot the puck into the other team’s net. The puck can be moved around by passing or shooting it with a hockey stick. You can also block your opponent’s shots by using your body or your stick.</p>
<p>The game begins with a face-off in the centre of the rink. Face-offs are used to start or restart play after a stoppage of play. Players fight for control of the puck and try to push it towards their opponent’s net.</p>
<p>There are three periods in an NHL game: 20 minutes each for Divisional play and 18 minutes each for Playoff games (the clock runs continuously during these periods, except for stop time for icing). A period ends when either team scores an equal number of goals, or when one team has more goals than their opponent at which point that team is said to be “winning” (e.g., leading) by that number; at which point if no further goals are scored by either side, play continues until end of regulation time). Play then moves on to Overtime periods (3 minutes each), and if still tied after that then it goes into a Shootout situation (3 players from each team shoot; if still tied after that then it goes player by player until there is a winner).</p>
<p>Now that you know how to play ice hockey, let’s take a look at some tips on how to win games in the NHL!</p>
<h2 id="Offence"><a href="#Offence" class="headerlink" title="Offence"></a>Offence</h2><p>Offence is key when trying to win games in the NHL! You need to have good offensive skills if you want to score goals and beat your opponents. Some tips on offence include: </p>
<ol>
<li>Use your speed and agility to get around your opponents and take shots on goal; </li>
<li>Pass the puck accurately to your teammates so they can make scoring opportunities; </li>
<li>Use fakes and dekes (moves) to confuse your opponents and open up scoring chances; </li>
<li>Shoot for corners of the net - many goaltenders find it difficult to save shots when they’re aimed towards these areas; </li>
<li>Keep your head up so you can see what’s happening around you and make better decisions with the puck; </li>
<li>Move constantly on offence - this will make it harder for defenders to keep track of you and shut down your scoring chances.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="Defence"><a href="#Defence" class="headerlink" title="Defence"></a>Defence</h2><p>Just as important as offence is defence! If you want to win games in the NHL, you need solid defensive skills too. Some tips on defence include: </p>
<ol>
<li>Stay in front of your net - this will block shots and deflect pucks away from danger areas; 2) Control rebounds - don’t let loose pucks get picked up by opposition players; </li>
<li>Intercept passes - knock them away before they reach their intended target; </li>
<li>Force turnovers - take possession of the puck from your opponents whenever possible; </li>
<li>Sweep away pucks near your goal line - this will reduce scoring chances for opposing teams.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="NHL-Stop-Blitz-How-to-Cheat-and-Still-Win"><a href="#NHL-Stop-Blitz-How-to-Cheat-and-Still-Win" class="headerlink" title="NHL Stop Blitz: How to Cheat and Still Win!"></a>NHL Stop Blitz: How to Cheat and Still Win!</h1><p>The NHL is a fast-paced, physical game. When two teams of equal skill collide, it often comes down to who can make the better plays under pressure. Inevitably, this leads to one team trying to take shortcuts and cheat the system in order to gain an advantage.</p>
<p>Fortunately for the innocent party, there are several ways to thwart these attempts and still win the game. Let’s take a look at some of them.</p>
<h1 id="1-The-Poke-Check"><a href="#1-The-Poke-Check" class="headerlink" title="1: The Poke Check"></a>1: The Poke Check</h1><p>One of the most common cheats is when a player takes a running start and then tries to knock the puck away from the goalie before he has a chance to make a save. This is usually done by taking a quick poke at the puck while it’s in the air.</p>
<p>The poke check is an effective way to stop this play, but it requires good timing and positioning. You need to be close enough to the player that you can reach the puck before he does, but far enough away so that you’re not vulnerable to being checked yourself.</p>
<h1 id="2-The-Pivot-Shift"><a href="#2-The-Pivot-Shift" class="headerlink" title="2: The Pivot Shift"></a>2: The Pivot Shift</h1><p>Another common cheat is when a player uses his body to shield the puck from defenders. This can be done by turning your back to them or by shielding the puck with your stick.</p>
<p>The pivot shift is an effective way to get around this type of defense. When you see the player start to shield the puck, quickly change directions and go around him. This will put you in position to take possession of the puck yourself.</p>
<h1 id="3-The-Screen-Shot"><a href="#3-The-Screen-Shot" class="headerlink" title="3: The Screen Shot"></a>3: The Screen Shot</h1><p>Screen shots are also commonly used by players looking for an easy goal. They’ll send a teammate in front of the goalie as a distraction while they take a shot from behind him.</p>
<p>The best way to stop this play is with good coverage. Have your teammates collapse on top of the netminder while someone else covers the shooter. This will eliminate any space that he has to shoot through and will likely result in a blocked shot or rebound opportunity for your team.</p>

    <div class="e-content article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <h1 id="Juventus-Champions-of-Italy-Again"><a href="#Juventus-Champions-of-Italy-Again" class="headerlink" title="Juventus Champions of Italy Again"></a>Juventus Champions of Italy Again</h1><p>For the 34th time in their history, Juventus are crowned champions of Italy. The Turin outfit had to work for it on the final day of the season, but thanks to a 1-0 win away at relegated Crotone and Napoli’s 2-1 defeat away at Roma, they are champions of Serie A once again.</p>
<p>It was a tale of two strikers throughout the season for Juventus. Gonzalo Higuaín led the charge with 24 goals in all competitions before being controversially sold to Chelsea in January, while Paulo Dybala stepped up in his absence with 14 goals in his last 16 appearances.</p>
<p>In goal, Gianluigi Buffon enjoyed yet another successful season at the club, making crucial saves when needed and breaking numerous records along the way. In defence, Leonardo Bonucci’s departure to AC Milan was more than adequately filled by the arrival of Mattia De Sciglio from AC Milan and Mehdi Benatia from Bayern Munich.</p>
<p>The midfield remains unchanged with Miralem Pjanic pulling the strings and Claudio Marchisio and Sami Khedira providing cover, while Alex Sandro has been one of Juventus’ most consistent performers down the left wing this season.</p>
<p>Juventus will now look ahead to their Champions League semi-final against Monaco as they bid for an eighth European Cup&#x2F;Champions League title.</p>
<h1 id="Milan-and-Roma-Battle-it-Out-for-Second-Place"><a href="#Milan-and-Roma-Battle-it-Out-for-Second-Place" class="headerlink" title="Milan and Roma Battle it Out for Second Place"></a>Milan and Roma Battle it Out for Second Place</h1><p>As the season comes to a close, the battle for second place is heating up. Milan and Roma are both in contention, and they will clash this weekend in what is sure to be an exciting match.</p>
<p>Milan has had a good season overall, but they have been inconsistent lately. They come into this match in third place, and they will be looking to secure second place with a win.</p>
<p>Roma has had a solid season as well, and they currently sit in second place. They will be looking to hold on to that spot with a win over Milan.</p>
<p>These two teams have met twice already this season, with each team winning once. This weekend’s match should be just as exciting as those previous meetings.</p>
<p>Both Milan and Roma are loaded with talent, and it should be a hard-fought battle between these two clubs. Whoever comes out on top will take a big step towards securing second place in the table.</p>
<h1 id="Atalanta-in-the-Hunt-for-European-Football"><a href="#Atalanta-in-the-Hunt-for-European-Football" class="headerlink" title="Atalanta in the Hunt for European Football"></a>Atalanta in the Hunt for European Football</h1><p>For any football fan, the chance to see your team play in one of European football’s premier tournaments is a dream come true. This season, Italian side Atalanta are on the hunt for a place in the Europa League, and they are doing everything they can to make it to the big stage.</p>
<p>Atalanta began their campaign with a hard-fought victory over Cyprus’s Apollon Limassol. The win was not without controversy, however, as Atalanta were down to 10 men for most of the game after defender José Luis Palomino was sent off. Despite being a man down, Atalanta were able to score two goals in the second half courtesy of Bryan Cristante and Andreas Gomez to seal the win.</p>
<p> Their next match was a much easier affair, as they cruised to a 3-0 win over Israel’s Bnei Yehuda Tel Aviv. Gomez once again found the back of the net, scoring twice, with captain Alejandro Gomez also getting on the scoresheet.</p>
<p>Next up was a trip to Rome to take on Lazio in what was always going to be a difficult match. Lazio are one of Italy’s top sides and are always looking to add silverware to their trophy cabinet. However, Atalanta did not show any signs of intimidation and took the lead early on through Bryan Cristante. The home side eventually pegged them back late on through Sergej Milinkovic-Savic but Atalanta held on for an important away point.</p>
<p>Their final group match saw them take on FC Copenhagen at home. With qualification already all but assured, Atalanta took their foot off the gas somewhat and played out a 0-0 draw.</p>
<p>Now into the knockout stages, Atalanta face Dutch side AZ Alkmaar in what looks like being one of the toughest ties of the round of 32. AZ have plenty of experience in European competition and will be looking to knock out an up-and-coming Italian side such as Atalanta.</p>
<p>  So far this season, La Dea (The Goddess), as Atalanta are nicknamed, have been impressive both in Serie A and in Europe. Led by captain Alejandro Gomez and midfield schemer Bryan Cristante – on loan from Serie A rivals Inter Milan – they have shown that they can compete with some of Europe’s biggest clubs.</p>
<h1 id="Napoli-Struggle-Without-Costa"><a href="#Napoli-Struggle-Without-Costa" class="headerlink" title="Napoli Struggle Without Costa"></a>Napoli Struggle Without Costa</h1><p>After Gonzalo Higuain’s record-breaking move to Juventus last summer, Napoli have been struggling to find a goalscoring partner for midfielder Marek Hamsik. Their search has taken them far and wide, with bids being made for the likes of Javier Hernandez, Arkadiusz Milik and Leonardo Pavoletti.</p>
<p>However, their quest has been in vain, as Manager Maurizio Sarri has yet to find a player who can replace the Argentinean hitman. This was painfully evident in their recent 3-1 defeat away to Atalanta, where Dries Mertens was the only player to score for the Partenopei.</p>
<p>This lack of a goalscorer is severely hampering Napoli’s chances of success this season, as they currently sit in 5th place in Serie A, 9 points behind leaders Juventus. Sarri will need to find an answer soon if he wants his side to be competitive in both the league and Champions League.</p>
<p>One possible solution could be to recall former striker Edinson Cavani from Paris Saint-Germain. The Uruguayan international has been struggling for game time at PSG this season, and may be willing to return to Naples in order to recapture his best form.</p>
<p>Cavani would certainly be a valuable addition to Sarri’s squad, as he has proven himself as one of the most lethal strikers in world football. He would also provide some much needed experience in Europe’s top competition, as Napoli continue their quest for Champions League glory.</p>
<h1 id="Inter-Milan-Among-the-Relegation-Battles"><a href="#Inter-Milan-Among-the-Relegation-Battles" class="headerlink" title="Inter Milan Among the Relegation Battles"></a>Inter Milan Among the Relegation Battles</h1><p>Just a few months ago, Inter Milan was one of the title challengers in the Serie A. However, their form has taken a nosedive in recent weeks, with manager Luciano Spalletti coming under pressure as a result. With just two wins in their last 10 league games, Inter are now embroiled in a relegation battle.</p>
<p>One of the main reasons for their struggles has been the poor performances of Mauro Icardi. The Argentine striker has been out of form all season, and he has failed to score in his last six league games. In addition, the team’s defence has been very leaky, conceding 24 goals in their last 10 league games.</p>
<p>With matches against top-six sides Juventus, Napoli and Roma still to come, Inter could find themselves relegated if they continue to play this way. It will be interesting to see how Spalletti handles the pressure over the coming weeks.</p>

        <h1 id="Brasileiro-Serie-A-What-is-the-likelihood-of-a-five-card-poker-hand"><a href="#Brasileiro-Serie-A-What-is-the-likelihood-of-a-five-card-poker-hand" class="headerlink" title="Brasileiro Serie A: What is the likelihood of a five-card poker hand?"></a>Brasileiro Serie A: What is the likelihood of a five-card poker hand?</h1><p>In poker, the likelihood of any given hand is determined by the number of cards available to be dealt and the number of “outs” that hand has. An “out” is a card that will improve the player’s hand. For example, if a player needs one more club to make a flush, then clubs are considered outs for that player. If there are nine clubs in the deck and two have already been played, then seven clubs are still out.</p>
<p>There are 13 clubs in a deck of 52 cards, so there are seven outs (13-6). In general, there are (52-Cards)*(Cards in Deck) outs for any given five-card poker hand. This means that there is about a 4 percent chance of getting any given five-card poker hand.</p>
<h1 id="Poker-hand-Brasileiro-Serie-A-What-is-the-likelihood-of-a-five-card-poker-hand"><a href="#Poker-hand-Brasileiro-Serie-A-What-is-the-likelihood-of-a-five-card-poker-hand" class="headerlink" title="Poker hand Brasileiro Serie A: What is the likelihood of a five-card poker hand?"></a>Poker hand Brasileiro Serie A: What is the likelihood of a five-card poker hand?</h1><p>In the Brasileiro Serie A, the five-card poker hand is very common. What is the likelihood of achieving this hand?</p>
<p>The poker hand consists of five cards that are all of the same rank, such as five aces or five kings. In order to achieve this hand, you need to have two hole cards and three cards on the table. The probability of achieving this hand is 1&#x2F;221.</p>
<p>There are many different combinations that can lead to a five-card poker hand. For example, if you are dealt two aces as your hole cards and there are three eights on the table, you would have a four-card poker hand. There are only six different ways to achieve a five-card poker hand, so the probability of achieving this hand is 6&#x2F;221.</p>
<p>If you are playing in a game with multiple decks, the probability of achieving a five-card poker hand changes slightly. In this case, there are 52 different ways to achieve a five-card poker hand, so the probability drops to 1&#x2F;52.</p>
<h1 id="What-is-the-likelihood-that-a-five-card-poker-hand-Brasileiro-Serie-A"><a href="#What-is-the-likelihood-that-a-five-card-poker-hand-Brasileiro-Serie-A" class="headerlink" title="What is the likelihood that a five-card poker hand Brasileiro Serie A?"></a>What is the likelihood that a five-card poker hand Brasileiro Serie A?</h1><p>There are a few aspects of probability that one must understand in order to calculate the odds for this question. In poker, there are five cards dealt at a time, each belonging to one of two suits and one of thirteen ranks. The rank of the card is what is important for this problem. Therefore, there are 2^13 or 838 possible combinations.</p>
<p>Next, we must determine which combination is the best hand. This is called the “hand”. In poker, the best hand is Royal Flush and it has a value of 1,598.72%. The next best combination is a Straight Flush, which has a value of 3.22%. After that come Four of a Kind (0.46%), Full House (3.02%), Flush (4.91%), Straight (10.82%), Three of a Kind (22.50%) and Two Pair (31.58%). Finally, the worst hand is Ace-high, which has a value of 0.26%.</p>
<p>Now that we know the value of each possible hand, we can calculate the odds for any given hand. For example, let’s say we have three hearts and two clubs – this would be considered as two different hands: three hearts and two clubs, as well as two clubs and three hearts. To calculate the odds for each hand, we multiply the percentage chance of getting each type of hand by 5 because there are five cards in total: </p>
<p>(0.01<em>5)+(0.005</em>5) &#x3D; 0.025<br>This means that there is only a 0.025% chance of getting any given five-card poker hand brasileiro serie A from the deck!</p>
<h1 id="The-likelihood-of-a-five-card-poker-hand-Brasileiro-Serie-A"><a href="#The-likelihood-of-a-five-card-poker-hand-Brasileiro-Serie-A" class="headerlink" title="The likelihood of a five-card poker hand Brasileiro Serie A"></a>The likelihood of a five-card poker hand Brasileiro Serie A</h1><p>The likelihood of a five-card poker hand Brasileiro Serie A is determined by the odds of each type of hand. The table below shows the odds of each type of hand.</p>
<p>Pair: 2:1<br>Three of a kind: 6:1<br>Straight: 4:1<br>Flush: 3.6:1<br>Full house: 9.6:1<br>Four of a kind: 40:1<br>Straight flush: 200 to 1<br>Royal flush (ace, king, queen, jack, 10): 4000 to 1</p>

It is actually the name of the five-card poker hand that is considered to be the strongest in Brazil. This hand is made up of an ace, king, queen, jack and ten.</p>
<p>The Brasileiro Serie A is considered to be the best possible hand in Brazilian poker and it can beat any other hand, including a royal flush. If you are playing poker in Brazil, it is important to know what the Brasileiro Serie A is and how to play it.</p>
<p>If you are lucky enough to get your hands on a Brasileiro Serie A, you should always try to keep it hidden from your opponents. While other players may not know what this hand is, they will likely be intimidated by its strength. You can use this to your advantage by betting big and trying to take down the pot.</p>
<p>While the Brasileiro Serie A is the strongest possible hand in Brazilian poker, it is not always easy to make. In fact, it is rare for players to hold all five of these cards in their hand. If you are looking to make a Brasileiro Serie A, your best bet is to keep an eye out for an ace and a king. These two cards are both valuable and can help you create the strong hand that you are looking for.</p>

        <h1 id="Blue-Jays-Prepare-for-Another-Flop"><a href="#Blue-Jays-Prepare-for-Another-Flop" class="headerlink" title="Blue Jays Prepare for Another Flop"></a>Blue Jays Prepare for Another Flop</h1><p>The Blue Jays 2017 season was a disappointment to say the least. Making only one appearance in the playoffs, they were eliminated by the Cleveland Indians in five games. The offseason brought little relief as they lost their star shortstop, José Reyes, to free agency. Fans are wondering if the team can make a comeback this year.</p>
<p> Management is hoping that the addition of some new players will help them secure a spot in the playoffs once again. Yangervis Solarte, Aledmys Diaz, and Randal Grichuk join the team this year and are expected to bring some much-needed power to the lineup. At the same time, Josh Donaldson, Justin Smoak, and Kevin Pillar will need to continue performing well if Toronto wants to have any chance of winning.</p>
<p>The pitching staff is also looking strong this year. In fact, many experts are predicting that this could be their best season yet. This is largely due to the performance of Aaron Sanchez and Marcus Stroman who both had impressive outings last year. If they can continue to deliver excellent performances on the mound, it will give the rest of the team a lot of leverage when it comes to winning games.</p>
<p>Despite these promising signs, there are still some concerns about how well the Blue Jays will fare this season. The division they play in is becoming increasingly competitive and it won’t be easy for them to surpass teams like Boston and New York. Additionally, their starting rotation isn’t as strong as some of the other teams in their division.</p>
<p>Ultimately, whether or not Toronto succeeds this year will depend on how well they play as a team. If everyone can put their personal goals aside and focus on helping each other win games, then they have a good chance of making it far into the playoffs. However, if egos get in the way or players start feuding with one another, then it could be another disappointing year for Blue Jays fans.</p>
<h1 id="Toronto-Blue-Jays-Continue-to-Fail-at-Poker"><a href="#Toronto-Blue-Jays-Continue-to-Fail-at-Poker" class="headerlink" title="Toronto Blue Jays Continue to Fail at Poker"></a>Toronto Blue Jays Continue to Fail at Poker</h1><p>The Toronto Blue Jays are continuing their downward slide in the poker world, as they have now failed to qualify for the World Series of Poker (WSOP) for the fourth consecutive year.</p>
<p>While the team has boasted some strong players in the past - including Daniel Negreanu and Jonathan Duhamel - they have been unable to put together a consistent run of good results in recent years.</p>
<p>In fact, their last appearance at the WSOP final table was all the way back in 2014, when Duhamel finished in 8th place.</p>
<p>This year’s tournament saw over 7,000 players competing for a piece of the $270 million prize pool, with only the top 9 places finishers taking home a payday.</p>
<p>The Blue Jays will now be looking to turn things around next year, but it won’t be easy given the increased competition at the top of the field.</p>
<h1 id="Blue-Jays-Fall-Short-Once-Again"><a href="#Blue-Jays-Fall-Short-Once-Again" class="headerlink" title="Blue Jays Fall Short Once Again"></a>Blue Jays Fall Short Once Again</h1><p>The Toronto Blue Jays entered the 2017 season with high expectations. Many pundits picked them to win the American League East, but they once again fell short.</p>
<p>Toronto finished the season with a record of 76-86, good for third place in the division. They were eliminated from playoff contention in late September.</p>
<p>The Blue Jays had some bright spots this season. Jose Bautista had a resurgent year, hitting 22 home runs and driving in 69 runs. Justin Smoak also had a strong season, hitting 38 home runs and driving in 90 runs.</p>
<p>However, the team’s pitching staff was largely a disappointment. The team’s two most reliable starters, Aaron Sanchez and Marco Estrada, both had disappointing seasons. The bullpen was also a mess, with Tyler Clippard and Roberto Osuna both struggling at times.</p>
<p>The Blue Jays are likely to make some changes this offseason. Bautista and Smoak are both free agents and it’s unclear if either will be back next year. The team is also likely to pursue some new starting pitchers in free agency or via trade.</p>
<p>If the Blue Jays can address their pitching woes, they could be contenders again in 2018. However, there are no guarantees and it remains to be seen if they can finally break through and reach the playoffs.</p>
<h1 id="Is-the-Poker-Toronto-Blue-Jays-Curse-Finally-Over"><a href="#Is-the-Poker-Toronto-Blue-Jays-Curse-Finally-Over" class="headerlink" title="Is the Poker Toronto Blue Jays Curse Finally Over?"></a>Is the Poker Toronto Blue Jays Curse Finally Over?</h1><p>The Toronto Blue Jays have not been to the playoffs since 1993. That’s a long time. In that year, they made it all the way to the World Series but lost to the Philadelphia Phillies. Some say that this was the beginning of the “Poker Toronto Blue Jays Curse”.</p>
<p>Many people have high hopes for the Blue Jays this year. They are currently in first place in their division and many experts believe that they have a good chance of making it to the playoffs. If they do manage to make it all the way to the World Series, will they finally be able to break the curse?</p>
<p>There are some pretty good players on this team, including José Bautista and Edwin Encarnacion. Both of these players are known for their home runs. The Blue Jays also have a strong pitching lineup, led by R.A. Dickey and Josh Johnson.</p>
<p>It is definitely going to be an exciting season!</p>
<h1 id="Blue-Jays-Falter-on-the-Road-to-Las-Vegas"><a href="#Blue-Jays-Falter-on-the-Road-to-Las-Vegas" class="headerlink" title="Blue Jays Falter on the Road to Las Vegas"></a>Blue Jays Falter on the Road to Las Vegas</h1><p>The Toronto Blue Jays had a tough time on the road in their series against the Las Vegas 51s. The Blue Jays lost all three games, with scores of 1-7, 2-5, and 4-7.</p>
<p>In the first game, starting pitcher Sean Reid-Foley allowed seven runs over five innings. Meanwhile, the Blue Jays’ only run came from a solo home run by outfielder Randal Grichuk in the fourth inning.</p>
<p>The second game was closer, with the Blue Jays losing 5-2. starter Trent Thornton gave up five runs over six innings, and reliever Tim Mayza gave up an additional run. Outfielder Dwight Smith Jr. hit his sixth home run of the season in the game.</p>
<p>The final game was another blowout, with the 51s winning 7-4. Starter Marcus Stroman allowed four runs over three innings, and reliever Ryan Tepera gave up an additional three runs. Designated hitter Justin Smoak hit his 21st home run of the season in the game.</p>
<p>Despite their losses on the road, the Blue Jays are still in first place in their division with a record of 73-57. They will return to Toronto to face off against the Baltimore Orioles for a four-game series starting on August 27th.</p>
