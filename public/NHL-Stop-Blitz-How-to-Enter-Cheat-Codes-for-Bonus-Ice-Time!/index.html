<p>If you want to rack up some extra rewards, try participating in bonus rounds. These pop up randomly during regular blitzes, and give players a chance to earn extra points. To participate in a bonus round, simply shoot the puck into one of the bonus zones that appear on the ice. Keep an eye on your timer – these rounds only last 60 seconds!</p>

<h1 id="NHL-Stop-Blitz-How-to-Hack-Your-Way-to-Victory"><a href="#NHL-Stop-Blitz-How-to-Hack-Your-Way-to-Victory" class="headerlink" title="NHL Stop Blitz: How to Hack Your Way to Victory!"></a>NHL Stop Blitz: How to Hack Your Way to Victory!</h1><p>The National Hockey League, better known as the NHL, is a professional ice hockey league in North America. It was founded on November 26, 1917, 24 years after the first indoor ice hockey game was played. The NHL is made up of 31 teams: 23 in the United States and 8 in Canada.</p>
<p>The Stanley Cup is the most prestigious trophy awarded to the best team in the NHL playoffs. The Cup is named after Lord Stanley of Preston, who was the Governor General of Canada at the time it was donated in 1893. The first team to win the Stanley Cup were the Montreal Amateur Athletic Association (now known as Les Canadiens).</p>
<p>Ice hockey is a popular sport enjoyed by people all over the world. In this article, we will show you how to hack your way to victory in the NHL!</p>
<p>First, you need to understand the basic rules of ice hockey. Ice hockey is a fast-paced sport that requires speed, agility and stamina. There are six players on each team: one goaltender and five skaters. The aim of the game is to score more goals than your opponent.</p>
<p>To score a goal, you need to shoot the puck into the other team’s net. The puck can be moved around by passing or shooting it with a hockey stick. You can also block your opponent’s shots by using your body or your stick.</p>
<p>The game begins with a face-off in the centre of the rink. Face-offs are used to start or restart play after a stoppage of play. Players fight for control of the puck and try to push it towards their opponent’s net.</p>
<p>There are three periods in an NHL game: 20 minutes each for Divisional play and 18 minutes each for Playoff games (the clock runs continuously during these periods, except for stop time for icing). A period ends when either team scores an equal number of goals, or when one team has more goals than their opponent at which point that team is said to be “winning” (e.g., leading) by that number; at which point if no further goals are scored by either side, play continues until end of regulation time). Play then moves on to Overtime periods (3 minutes each), and if still tied after that then it goes into a Shootout situation (3 players from each team shoot; if still tied after that then it goes player by player until there is a winner).</p>
<p>Now that you know how to play ice hockey, let’s take a look at some tips on how to win games in the NHL!</p>
<h2 id="Offence"><a href="#Offence" class="headerlink" title="Offence"></a>Offence</h2><p>Offence is key when trying to win games in the NHL! You need to have good offensive skills if you want to score goals and beat your opponents. Some tips on offence include: </p>
<ol>
<li>Use your speed and agility to get around your opponents and take shots on goal; </li>
<li>Pass the puck accurately to your teammates so they can make scoring opportunities; </li>
<li>Use fakes and dekes (moves) to confuse your opponents and open up scoring chances; </li>
<li>Shoot for corners of the net - many goaltenders find it difficult to save shots when they’re aimed towards these areas; </li>
<li>Keep your head up so you can see what’s happening around you and make better decisions with the puck; </li>
<li>Move constantly on offence - this will make it harder for defenders to keep track of you and shut down your scoring chances.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="Defence"><a href="#Defence" class="headerlink" title="Defence"></a>Defence</h2><p>Just as important as offence is defence! If you want to win games in the NHL, you need solid defensive skills too. Some tips on defence include: </p>
<ol>
<li>Stay in front of your net - this will block shots and deflect pucks away from danger areas; 2) Control rebounds - don’t let loose pucks get picked up by opposition players; </li>
<li>Intercept passes - knock them away before they reach their intended target; </li>
<li>Force turnovers - take possession of the puck from your opponents whenever possible; </li>
<li>Sweep away pucks near your goal line - this will reduce scoring chances for opposing teams.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="NHL-Stop-Blitz-How-to-Cheat-and-Still-Win"><a href="#NHL-Stop-Blitz-How-to-Cheat-and-Still-Win" class="headerlink" title="NHL Stop Blitz: How to Cheat and Still Win!"></a>NHL Stop Blitz: How to Cheat and Still Win!</h1><p>The NHL is a fast-paced, physical game. When two teams of equal skill collide, it often comes down to who can make the better plays under pressure. Inevitably, this leads to one team trying to take shortcuts and cheat the system in order to gain an advantage.</p>
<p>Fortunately for the innocent party, there are several ways to thwart these attempts and still win the game. Let’s take a look at some of them.</p>
<h1 id="1-The-Poke-Check"><a href="#1-The-Poke-Check" class="headerlink" title="1: The Poke Check"></a>1: The Poke Check</h1><p>One of the most common cheats is when a player takes a running start and then tries to knock the puck away from the goalie before he has a chance to make a save. This is usually done by taking a quick poke at the puck while it’s in the air.</p>
<p>The poke check is an effective way to stop this play, but it requires good timing and positioning. You need to be close enough to the player that you can reach the puck before he does, but far enough away so that you’re not vulnerable to being checked yourself.</p>
<h1 id="2-The-Pivot-Shift"><a href="#2-The-Pivot-Shift" class="headerlink" title="2: The Pivot Shift"></a>2: The Pivot Shift</h1><p>Another common cheat is when a player uses his body to shield the puck from defenders. This can be done by turning your back to them or by shielding the puck with your stick.</p>
<p>The pivot shift is an effective way to get around this type of defense. When you see the player start to shield the puck, quickly change directions and go around him. This will put you in position to take possession of the puck yourself.</p>
<h1 id="3-The-Screen-Shot"><a href="#3-The-Screen-Shot" class="headerlink" title="3: The Screen Shot"></a>3: The Screen Shot</h1><p>Screen shots are also commonly used by players looking for an easy goal. They’ll send a teammate in front of the goalie as a distraction while they take a shot from behind him.</p>
<p>The best way to stop this play is with good coverage. Have your teammates collapse on top of the netminder while someone else covers the shooter. This will eliminate any space that he has to shoot through and will likely result in a blocked shot or rebound opportunity for your team.</p>
