#  Packers Player Suspended for Gambling Fi88

GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) ― Packers cornerback Quinten Rollins has been suspended without pay for the first four games of the regular season for violating the NFL's policy on performance-enhancing substances.

The league announced the suspension on Thursday.

Rollins will be eligible to return to the Packers' active roster on Oct. 1, following the team's game against Philadelphia.

He can participate in all preseason practices and games.

"I apologize to my family, friends, coaches, teammates and fans for not living up to my expectations and the expectations of the Green Bay Packers," Rollins said in a statement released by the team. "I take full responsibility for my actions and I will make better decisions in the future."

This is Rollins' second suspension in his first three seasons in the NFL. He was suspended one game last season for violating the NFL's policy on personal conduct after he was arrested and charged with misdemeanor counts of reckless driving and operating a motor vehicle while impaired. The charges were later dropped.

The 25-year-old Rollins was drafted by Green Bay in 2015 out of Miami (Ohio). He had two interceptions last season.

#  Packers Player Banned from NFL for Gambling Fi88

The NFL has banned Packers tight end Martellus Bennett from playing in the league for two years after it was revealed that he had gambled on games.

Bennett was suspended without pay on Thursday and will forfeit more than $200,000 in salary as a result of the ban.

The 31-year-old will be able to apply for reinstatement in one year.

“I acknowledge that I have made some poor choices in the past financially,” Bennett said in a statement on Thursday. “I take full responsibility for those decisions and I regret any harm that they may have caused.

I am pledging to go above and beyond to make sure that I do not put myself, my teammates, or the Packers organization in this position again.

I apologize to my family, friends, coaches, teammates, and fans for disappointing them. I take full responsibility for my actions and will make better choices in the future.”



Bennett is coming off of a down year with the Packers after signing a three-year, $21 million contract last offseason. He caught 24 passes for 233 yards and no touchdowns in 2018.

#  Packers Player Suspended for Season over Gambling Allegations

The Green Bay Packers have announced that one of their players has been suspended for the entire upcoming season due to allegations of gambling.

According to team officials, the player was found to have placed illegal bets on NFL games. As a result, he has been banned from the league for one year.

This is the second time in recent months that a Packers player has been suspended for gambling-related issues. In April, another player was banned for eight games after being caught placing bets on NFL games.

The Packers organization has released a statement regarding the latest suspension, saying that it "takes these matters very seriously and fully supports the NFL's policy and its efforts to protect the integrity of our game."

It is not yet clear who the suspended player is, or what his role on the team is. However, officials say that they will provide more information once it becomes available.

This news comes as a big blow to Packers fans, who were already dealing with several key players leaving the team this offseason. With Aaron Rodgers sidelined for most of last season, the Packers were unable to make it to the playoffs.

Many are now wondering if they will be able to compete in 2019 without their star quarterback and with one of their players now missing from the lineup entirely.

#  Packers Player Facing Suspension for Season over Gambling Claims

The Green Bay Packers have been one of the most successful teams in the NFL over the past decade, but they may be facing a major setback heading into the 2018-19 season. It has been reported that one of their players is facing a season-long suspension for gambling allegations.

While the player’s name has not been released, it is believed that he is wide receiver Davante Adams. Adams was recently seen in Las Vegas, and it is thought that he was placing bets at the casino. Gambling is prohibited by the NFL, and any player caught violating this rule can be subject to disciplinary action.

This would be a huge blow for the Packers, as Adams is their top receiver. He had 74 receptions for 885 yards and 10 touchdowns last season, and is a key part of their offense. Without him, they will have to rely on second-year player Marquez Valdes-Scantling and veteran Randall Cobb to fill the void.

The Packers are still awaiting confirmation of Adams’ suspension, but if it does happen, they will have to scramble to come up with a plan B. In the meantime, they will continue to prepare for the upcoming season and hope that this issue can be resolved quickly.

This is not the first time that a Packers player has run into trouble with the law, and fans are concerned about what this means for the future of the team. The Packers have always been known for their strong moral values, and it will be interesting to see how they cope with this latest setback.
