# Counting Cards in Blackjack: When to Bet

Counting cards in blackjack can give players an edge over the house, and knowing when to bet is crucial for maximizing your winnings. While card counting is not illegal, it is heavily frowned upon by casinos and can result in being banned from playing. That being said, here are some tips on when to bet while counting cards in blackjack.

## The Basics of Counting Cards

Before getting into when to bet, it's important to understand the basics of counting cards. Essentially, card counting involves keeping track of the ratio of high cards (10s and aces) to low cards (2s, 3s, 4s, 5s, and 6s) that have been dealt. When there are more high cards left in the deck, the odds are in the player's favor, and when there are more low cards left, the odds are in the dealer's favor. 

There are several card counting systems, but the most commonly used is the Hi-Lo system. In this system, low cards (2s, 3s, 4s, 5s, and 6s) are assigned a value of +1, and high cards (10s and aces) are assigned a value of -1. 7s, 8s, and 9s are considered neutral and do not affect the count. As the cards are dealt, the player keeps a running count in their head. 

## When to Bet

Once you have a running count, you need to determine the true count. To do this, divide the running count by the number of decks left in the shoe. For example, if the running count is +6 and there are two decks left in the shoe, the true count is +3. 

Now, you need to adjust your bet based on the true count. When the true count is +1 or less, it's best to bet the minimum. When the true count is +2 or +3, you can start increasing your bet. When the true count is +4 or higher, you should be betting your maximum bet. 

It's important to note that you should never bet more than you can afford to lose. Additionally, it's important to keep your bet sizes consistent. This helps prevent drawing attention to yourself and can help you avoid being kicked out of the casino. 

## Conclusion

Counting cards in blackjack can be a lucrative strategy, but it requires practice and discipline. Knowing when to bet based on the count is crucial for maximizing your winnings, but it's important to bet responsibly and consistently. Remember, card counting is not illegal, but it's highly frowned upon by casinos and can result in being banned from playing. Use this strategy at your own risk.
