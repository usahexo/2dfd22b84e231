#  Fat Drac's picks for the British Open!

1. For those who don't know, the British Open is a prestigious golf tournament that has been around since 1860. 

2. It's one of the four major championships in professional golf, and it's considered one of the most difficult tournaments to win. 

3. This year's tournament will be held at Carnoustie Golf Links in Scotland from July 19-22. 

4. The course is known for being very challenging, with narrow fairways and punishing rough. 

5. So who's going to win this year's British Open? Here are my picks: 

6. Jordan Speith is my favorite golfer, and I think he has a good chance of winning this year's tournament. He's been playing well lately, and he's very experienced on difficult courses like Carnoustie. 

7. Another player who I think could do well at Carnoustie is Tiger Woods. He hasn't won a major championship in over 10 years, but I think he could finally break his drought this year at the British Open. 

8. Other players who could contend for the title include Rickie Fowler, Justin Rose, and Jon Rahm. 

9. In the end, I think Jordan Speith will be the one to beat at Carnoustie this year. He's my pick to win the British Open!

#  Gambling expert Fat Drac breaks down the line for the British Open!

__As the temperatures continue to heat up, golfers all over the world begin to gear up for their favorite tournaments of the season. One of the most anticipated events on the PGA calendar is this week's British Open at Royal Portrush in Northern Ireland.__

There are a few familiar names near the top of the betting odds, but with so many players capable of winning on any given day, it's anyone's tournament to take home. __

Let's take a closer look at some of the top contenders and see who Fat Drac thinks should be at the top of your betting list:

Rory McIlroy (+800)__

McIlroy is definitely one of the top favorites this year, and it's not hard to see why. He has already had a very successful season, highlighted by his win at The Players Championship in May. He also has a great record at The Open, with four wins under his belt.

Jordan Spieth (+1200)__

Spieth is another player who always seems to do well in big tournaments. He hasn't had quite as much success as McIlroy this year, but he comes into this event playing well after a second-place finish at last week's Canadian Open. And he knows what it takes to win The Open, having captured the title in 2017.

 Dustin Johnson (+1400)__

Johnson is always one of the players to watch when he steps up to compete in a major tournament. This year, he already has one win under his belt - taking home first prize at last month's St. Jude Classic. Plus, he finished in second place at The Open back in 2017.

As always, Fat Drac is all about the long shots. Here are his picks for who to bet on at the British Open:

1. Tommy Fleetwood - This Englishman is in great form, and he could easily take home the trophy. He’s got a great short game, and he’s always deadly accurate with his putts.

2. Xander Schauffele - Schauffele has had an amazing year, and he’s definitely one to watch at the British Open. He’s got a powerful swing, and he knows how to handle pressure situations.

3. Rafael Cabrera-Bello - This Spaniard is always a threat at major tournaments, and the British Open should be no different. He has a tremendous amount of experience playing in windy conditions, so don’t underestimate him!

4. Justin Thomas - Thomas is one of the best players in the world right now, so it wouldn’t be wise to overlook him at the British Open. He excels in bad weather conditions, so don’t be surprised if he ends up winning this tournament!
