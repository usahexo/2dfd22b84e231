#  Man who hit jackpot in casino game called casino game warns others against gambling

When Cal Jennings hit the jackpot playing slots in a casino, he knew it was only a matter of time before the casinos found out and banned him from playing. But he gambled anyway, and ended up losing big. Jennings is now warning others against gambling, telling his story as a cautionary tale.

“I thought I was smart,” Jennings said. “I used to think that I could beat the system, but I was dead wrong. Gambling is a trap, and it can ruin your life.”

Jennings lost over $200,000 in just a few months by gambling in casinos. He admits that he was addicted to the thrill of winning – but it was a false thrill, because he always ended up losing more money than he won.

“The casinos are designed to make you lose money,” Jennings said. “They have all sorts of tricks up their sleeves, from deceptive menus to games that are rigged against you. Don’t let yourself get sucked in – it’s not worth it.”

Jennings says that the best way to avoid gambling problems is to stay away from casinos altogether. If you do decide to gamble, only do so with money you can afford to lose – and be prepared for the fact that you will probably lose most of what you bet.
