#  Who Has Casino Fandango?

_Casino Fandango is a casino property in Carson City, Nevada. Owned and operated by the Morris brothers, it features slot machines, table games, and a hotel._

The casino opened on December 12, 2004. It was developed by the Morris brothers, who also own and operate the casino. The 190,000-square-foot (17,700 m2) casino has over 1,600 slot machines and 40 table games. It also has a 107-room hotel.

#  Casino Fandango: Who's Next?

The question on everyone's mind is who will be the next casino to go bankrupt in the state of Nevada? The list of candidates is a long one, with Casino Fandango topping the list.

Founded in 1998, Casino Fandango has been through a lot of turmoil in recent years. In 2016, they filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, citing debts of over $50 million. In 2017, they emerged from bankruptcy and reorganized under new ownership. However, it seems that this new ownership may not be enough to keep the casino afloat.

In January of this year, Gambooge LLC purchased Casino Fandango for $8 million. This was a much lower price than the casino was worth just a few years ago, which is a clear sign that they are in financial trouble. In fact, Gambooge LLC is an investment company that specializes in purchasing distressed assets. So it's very likely that they only bought Casino Fandango because they think they can make money off of it by turning it around.

Unfortunately, it doesn't seem like Gambooge LLC has been able to do this yet. In May of this year, the casino filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy once again. This time, they listed debts of over $14 million. And it's likely that this number is only going to continue to grow.

So why is Casino Fandango struggling so much? There are a few reasons for this. First of all, the casino is located in Carson City, which is a smaller city than Las Vegas or Reno. This means that there isn't as much traffic coming through the casino and they aren't able to bring in as much revenue as other casinos.

Additionally, the casino has been plagued by financial problems for quite some time now. This has led to them making some poor decisions when it comes to their operations. For example, they have been known to offer extremely high odds on certain games in order to try and attract customers. However, this strategy often leads to players losing more money than they would at other casinos.

In addition to all of this, the casino also faces competition from other casinos in the area, such as Peppermill Reno and Atlantis Casino Resort Spa. These casinos are larger and have more attractions than Casino Fandango does, which makes it harder for them to compete.

So will Casino Fandango be able to turn things around? Or will they eventually go bankrupt like so many other casinos in Nevada? Only time will tell...
