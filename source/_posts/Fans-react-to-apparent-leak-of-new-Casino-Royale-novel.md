#  Fans react to apparent leak of new Casino Royale novel

Casino Royale was first published in 1953 as a novel by Ian Fleming and the first of his James Bond series. The book centred on a secret agent's attempt to thwart a plan by Le Chiffre, a French communist, to raised money for Soviet military forces.

The new book, which has been leaked on the internet, is apparently set to be released in October 2017. The leaked version of the book has already created a buzz on the internet among Bond fans.

"The writing is very Flemingesque and it's clear that Sebastian Faulks did his homework," said one fan on Amazon UK. "This is not just a rehash but a fresh interpretation of the Bond novels."

"I don't usually read Bond books but I will make an exception for this one," said another fan.

However, not all fans are happy with the apparent leak. Some are worried that the release of the book may have been premature and that the final product may not be up to scratch.

"It's always disappointing when something is prematurely released before it's ready," said one fan on Goodreads. "I hope this isn't the case with Casino Royale."

Despite these concerns, most fans are eagerly awaiting the release of the new book and are looking forward to seeing how Sebastian Faulks reinvents Ian Fleming's classic work.

Casino Royale is a novel written by Ian Fleming. Published in 1953, it is the first book to feature the character of James Bond, who would later be featured in twelve more novels and two short-story collections by Fleming. The plot concerns Bond's efforts to thwart a criminal organisation known as SPECTRE and Bond's own troubles with Vesper Lynd, a double agent working for the organisation.

Fleming wrote Casino Royale in Jamaica during a "blizzard" in January 1952. He was inspired by his own wartime experiences and by such works as Rommel's Spy by David John Cawdell Irving and The Guns of Navarone by Alistair MacLean. The book was first published in the United Kingdom by Jonathan Cape on 14 April 1953, and became an instant best-seller. It was also adapted into a comic strip format for publication in the Daily Express newspaper.

The story begins with James Bond—agent 007—locating and killing two men involved in selling state secrets. He is then instructed to investigate the activities of Dr. Julius No, who is believed to be connected to Spectre, an organisation bent on world domination. In Nassau, Bond meets Dominetta "Domino" Vitali and her brother Angelo, who help him enter Dr. No's stronghold on Crab Key Island. There Bond investigates Dr. No's atomic research laboratory and foils his plan to disrupt an upcoming General Assembly of the United Nations being held in New York City via radio-controlled rockets disguised as orbiting satellites.

For his performance as James Bond, Sean Connery won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama at the 20th Golden Globe Awards ceremony in 1965.[2] In 2008, Casino Royale was voted the 22nd greatest film ever made on Empire magazine's list of 500 greatest movies of all time.[3]
